# 🏎️ F1 Race Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict Formula 1 race outcomes using **machine learning** and **historical race data**. By analyzing driver performance, team statistics, weather conditions, and track characteristics, we develop a predictive model to forecast race results with high accuracy.

## 🔍 Key Features
- **Data-Driven Predictions**: Utilizes past race results, lap times, and driver stats.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements regression and classification algorithms.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and transforms race data for analysis.
- **Performance Visualization**: Insights into model accuracy and feature importance.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset includes:
- **Race results from 2000 onward**
- **Driver & team performance metrics**
- **Weather conditions & track details**
- NOTE : This dataset was prepared by me using the Ergast API

## 🚀 Installation & Usage
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mohammed-Yasar/F1-Race-Prediction.git
cd F1-Race-Prediction
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📈 Results & Performance
- **Model Accuracy**: 85%+ on test data.
- **Top Influencing Factors**: Driver experience, team ranking, weather impact.

 *Further improvements include deep learning approaches and real-time data integration.*

## Technologies Used
- **Python**, **Pandas**, **Scikit-learn**, **XGBoost**
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive analysis
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization

## Future Enhancements
- Integrating real-time race data
- Deep learning models for improved accuracy
- Web app for user-friendly predictions
